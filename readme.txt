Revert back to the legacy mobile menu in the GeneratePress theme.

== Description ==

Revert back to the legacy mobile menu in the GeneratePress theme.

Simply install, activate and you're done!

This plugin requires GeneratePress to be your active theme - without GeneratePress, this plugin is useless.

== Installation ==

There's two ways to install.

1. Go to "Plugins > Add New" in your Dashboard and search for: Generate Legacy Mobile Menu
2. Download the .zip from WordPress.org, and upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.

In most cases, #1 will work fine and is way easier.
